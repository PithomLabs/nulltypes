`nulltypes` is a golang module that provides an alternative to `database/sql` nullable data types with proper JSON marshalling and unmarshalling.

It also provides a wrapper for `time.Time` to format time in `UTC` for using with SQL database.

## Usage

```
import "github.com/datumbrain/nulltypes"
```
